<h1>Hi there 👋</h1>

<p>
  I'm Kelechi. I'm currently a Software Engineer Intern at GitHub. I'm working on the Migrations Team for GitHub Enterprise! I'm also a rising senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I love to learn new things and build amazing projects!
</p>

<p>
  Outside of school and work, I enjoy:
  <ul>
    <li>
      🎮 Video Games. Valorant, League of Legends, or any game! I love to play and am super competitive. 
    </li>
    <li>
      🏋️ Gym. I go to the gym 5-6 times a week. Some would say I'm addicted, but I would say I just love the grind...
    </li>
    <li>
      💻 Programming. Yes, I know. This is expected, but I really do love programming, and do it even in my free time! I love building projects around my interests, and constantly discovering ways to improve.
    </li>
    <li>
      🧴👃 Perfume/Colognes. I love to collect any type of fragrances! My collection is huge, and everytime I buy a new scent, it's like a whole new experience!

  </ul>
